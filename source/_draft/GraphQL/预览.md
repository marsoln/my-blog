# Overview 预览

GraphQL is a query language designed to build client applications by providing
an intuitive and flexible syntax and system for describing their data
requirements and interactions.

GraphQL是一个查询语言的设计,为构建客户端应用提供了一个直观又灵活的描述它们数据需求和交互的语法和系统.

For example, this GraphQL request will receive the name of the user with id 4
from the Facebook implementation of GraphQL.

例如,下面这个GraghQL请求会从facebook的GraphQL接口实现中接收到ID为4的用户的name.

```graphql
{
  user(id: 4) {
    name
  }
}
```

Which produces the resulting data (in JSON):

将会产生如下结果(json格式):

```js
{
  "user": {
    "name": "Mark Zuckerberg"
  }
}
```

GraphQL is not a programming language capable of arbitrary computation, but is
instead a language used to query application servers that have
capabilities defined in this specification. GraphQL does not mandate a
particular programming language or storage system for application servers that
implement it. Instead, application servers take their capabilities and map them
to a uniform language, type system, and philosophy that GraphQL encodes.
This provides a unified interface friendly to product development and a powerful
platform for tool-building.

GraphQL 不是一种可以进行任意计算的编程语言,而是一种用于查询实现了此规范中所定义能力的应用服务器的语言.  
GraphQL没有使应用服务器拘泥于一个指定的编程语言或者存储系统去实现它.  
相反,应用服务器基将其能力映射到一个统一的由GraphQL编码的语言,类型系统和理念中去
这提供了一个对产品开发友好的统一接口和一个强大的工具构建平台.  

GraphQL has a number of design principles:

GraphQL有如下几个设计原则:

 * **Hierarchical**: Most product development today involves the creation and
   manipulation of view hierarchies. To achieve congruence with the structure
   of these applications, a GraphQL query itself is structured hierarchically.
   The query is shaped just like the data it returns. It is a natural
   way for clients to describe data requirements.

 * **分层**: 今天大多数产品开发都涉及到视图层的创建和操控.为了保证与这些应用架构的一致性,一个GraphQL查询本身必须是多层级结构的.查询和返回的数据正好吻合。这正是天生支持了客户端描述数据需求。

 * **Product-centric**: GraphQL is unapologetically driven by the requirements
   of views and the front-end engineers that write them. GraphQL starts with
   their way of thinking and requirements and build the language and runtime
   necessary to enable that.

 * **以产品为中心**: GraphQL无疑是被视图和制作它们的前端攻城尸们的需求所驱动的.GraphQL源于他们的思维方式和需求建立了这种语言,运行时必须去实现它.

 * **Strong-typing**: Every GraphQL server defines an application-specific
   type system. Queries are executed within the context of that type system.
   Given a query, tools can ensure that the query is both syntactically
   correct and valid within the GraphQL type system before execution, i.e. at
   development time, and the server can make certain guarantees about the shape
   and nature of the response.

 * **强类型**: 每个GraphQL服务器定义一个针对该应用的类型系统.所有查询都在这个类型系统的上下文中执行.一个查询,工具可以在执行前保证这个查询既没有语法错误又要在当前GraphQL类型系统中通过验证.*也就是说在开发时,服务器可以保证response的形态和性质.*

 * **Client-specified queries**: Through its type system, a GraphQL server
   publishes the capabilities that its clients are allowed to consume. It is
   the client that is responsible for specifying exactly how it will consume
   those published capabilities. These queries are specified at field-level
   granularity. In the majority of client-server applications written
   without GraphQL, the server determines the data returned in its various
   scripted endpoints. A GraphQL query, on the other hand, returns exactly what
   a client asks for and no more.

 * **客户端指定的查询**: 通过类型系统,一个GraphQL 服务器公开了其客户端可以使用的功能.客户端负责精确地描述其如何使用这些公开的功能.这些查询指定字段级别的颗粒度.大多数没有使用GraphQL去书写的客户端应用中,服务器决定了返回给各个终端的数据.而相较之下,一个GraphQL的查询,返回的是客户端所需的精确格式的数据,别无其他.

 * **Introspective**: GraphQL is introspective. A GraphQL server's type system
   must be queryable by the GraphQL language itself, as will be described in this
   specification. GraphQL introspection serves as a powerful platform for
   building common tools and client software libraries.

 * **自省性**: GraphQL 拥有自省性.一个GraphQL服务器的类型系统必须可以被GraphQL语言查询,并且会按照这个规范定义描述.GraphQL的自检性为构建通用工具和客户端类库提供了一个强大的平台.

Because of these principles, GraphQL is a powerful and productive environment
for building client applications. Product developers and designers building
applications against working GraphQL servers -- supported with quality tools --
can quickly become productive without reading extensive documentation and with
little or no formal training. To enable that experience, there must be those
that build those servers and tools.

因为这些原则,GraphQL是一个用于构建客户端应用的强大的且富有成效的环境.产品开发和设计人员构建基于GraphQL服务的应用 -- 配合质量工具 -- 可以不用阅读扩展文档,只需些许培训就可以快速上手. 要实现这种体验,前提是构建这样的服务和工具.

The following formal specification serves as a reference for those builders.
It describes the language and its grammar, the type system and the
introspection system used to query it, and the execution and validation engines
with the algorithms to power them. The goal of this specification is to provide
a foundation and framework for an ecosystem of GraphQL tools, client libraries,
and server implementations -- spanning both organizations and platforms -- that
has yet to be built. We look forward to working with the community
in order to do that.

下面的正式规范给这些构建者的以参考.它描述了这个语言和它的语法,类型系统以及用于查询它的自检系统,强化算法的执行和校验引擎.这份规范的目标是为尚未构建的/跨组织和平台的GraphQL工具,客户端类库和服务器端实现的生态系统提供一个依据和框架.为此我们期待着能和社区成员一同努力实现.
